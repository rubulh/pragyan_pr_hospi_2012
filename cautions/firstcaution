i could not get the preg replace working in the allglobals file ie /var/www/html/pragyan/files/allglobals.php and have hardcoded the $MAINTABLE  for now fix it later so as to make it compatible with all servers

>>1324283323
the css pages needed the urls of the various images but i wanted to make all urls independent of hardcoding but the css pages dont interpret the php code so i could not make the css work in my way so what i did is that i commented the css link line in the mainfile and pasted all the css file contents between <style> and </style>
try to figure out a better way of dong that 

>>in the gethostels.php file i have not yet included the file which provides the mysql connection
the file name and its function is to be decided and included 

>>in the gethostels and the getrooms file for now i have commented the database retrival part and have hard coded the hostel array ;this needs to be changed later

>>some variables need to be there in the mysql file
like
$ACCOMODATIONMYSQLTABLE
and that table need to have the following fields
STAYING
HOSTELNAMES
EMAIL
NAME
CELL
ROOM
COLLEGE
CHECKIN
CHECKOUT


>>in the getrooms file i have to add orderby rooms ascending but i have not as i am not sure of the syntax also i have used distinct in two places getrooms and gethostels but the syntax is not verified
